# **Pivot Devlog**

Pivot is a solo project made using the Godot 4.x Engine/GDScript. It is my first project since completeing The Tech Academy's Game Developer Course.  

Start date: 24/09/22 (originally 26/06/22 using Godot 3.x, but had to start over after engine upgrade)  

Skill level: Novice  

## **Overview**

This project is based off of an idea I've been holding for a few years now, along with several others, since I first made the decision to persue game development. I chose this project for it's simplicity yet wide range of concepts to help me practice.  

Pivot is based off an old Mac game that I played in the mid 90's called Spin Doctor. It was very rudimentary in its concepts, so I figured I might be able to recreate a semblance of the game while improving upon it.  

## **Game Summary**

You control Pivot as it rotates around colored dots. The goal is to jump from dot to dot, gaining points, until you've reached a gratuitously high score.
<br>
When the wheel at the bottom fills, you can pivot the map 90deg in any direction.
<br>
In survival mode, you must also avoid TUV as you aim to earn a high score.

My goal was to make a hyper casual game to relax to, but for those who wanted a little more challenge I added that too. I hope I've achieved this.

## **Initial Setup**

I started by writing my ideas down in a whiteboard app. Getting things out made it very easy to organize them into what order I wanted to complete them. The ideas were vague and turned into an outline of about a page long.  

Being new to Godot, I watched a few tutorials for 2d and 3d until I decided on using 3d for the game. Then I built my folder structure. I'm still not sure what the best practice is, but from what I can find it doesn't really matter for small projects. I decided on grouping things by gameplay layers (eg. maps, player, enemy, collectables).  

## **First Success -- Movement**

Getting the first map, a 'dot' object, and player made were relatively simple and I don't really consider this my first success since a few images floating in space seemed trivial. I spent about 12 hours researching and trying to find/plan out the best way to control the player in relation to the dots. In hindsight, my first attempt was good, but not efficient. Contrary to my first instinct, I decided to build the player movement handling off of the dot scripts since it seemed easiest to pull the positioning of the dots this way as well as control their signals (events).  

After suffering a headache and possibly a bout of food poisoning, I let my frustration get the better of me and decided to create a new branch in GitHub Desktop to see if coding player movement off the player script would work. This turned out to be the right choice, not only was I able to reproduce the same effects with about 50% less code, but it feels like I was able to fine-tune it more too.  

Behold! A stick, jumping between colored dots, while alternating rotation speed and direction. Don't let my skills fool you, timing the center of the dots to increase rotation speed is actually quite tricky. The player can hold down the action button to jump to the next dot, but it won't register as a 'center hit' and won't increase speed.

## **Second Success -- Changing Colors**  

\*Long Inhale\*  
So... This step was more aggrovating than it should have been. Not only were there no solid answers online, but the solution seemed to come from the left while I was looking right. It turns out that Godot conserves memory by sharing the Material resource amongst every instance of an object that uses the Material. So if I try to change the color of the Material, it changes the color across all instances. I spent about 10 hours testing out different approaches based on hints I got online. What finally ended up working was creating seperate Mesh files for each color that I intend to use, then loading the Meshes into their own variable and applying it whenever I want to change an objects color.  
  
Forgive me if I didn't find the most efficient or practical way to do this, but it works.

<br>
After another hour of tinkering I got more colors and a scoreboard.

## **Auto-Generating Map... and Singletons?Â¿**

\*Personal Note\* I took a hiatus that was intended to be only a few weeks or a month, but I lost motivation and also got and lost a job in the proceeding months.

So I discovered Godot has it's own form of 'singletons' that it calls Autoload. This has helped me greatly. I managed to find a way to generate dots as the player moves in any direction, but I can't seem to figure out why they will keep generating even if there is a dot already there.

After about 20 hours of research and testing out different approaches, I sought help from a Discord server. The solution ended up being rather simple and seems to be very efficient. Apparently, I misunderstood how Godot handles dictionaries.
<br>
Solution: Create a dictionary of Vector3 coords and the corresponding Dot object, then just look up the coordinates in the dictionary to determine if a Dot needs placed or not.
Amazingly, this seems scalable to 3D and this approach could probably also work when I go to implement obstacles/enemies/collectables.

## **Camera Control and Obstructions**

Wait... I have an idea. I decided to spend a couple hours redoing my player scene to include a parent node. I hope this wasn't a waste of time, but it seems it would be much simpler to control the camera this way. Oh, also, I moved the camera to be a child of this parent node in the player scene so that it will always follow the player around.

I ran into a problem now. How do I smooth the camera movement if it's tethered to the player position? I can't seem to get lerp or interpolate to work. My head hurts, this is a problem for future me.

For now, I decided to implement a way of hiding objects between the camera viewport and the player. I ended up just using an area shape and setting up signals to toggle the objects visibility.

My next objective is to figure out the best way to keep track of the player orientation. This will directly tie into how I flesh out the map generation. I'm hoping I can find a mathematical way to orient everything, but if I can't the next best thing seems to map out each possible position (24 possible) and changing the player state as needed. This will likely work, but doesn't seem to be very efficient.

Captain's Log 5/31/23: ...I couldn't sleep. As I lie awake my thoughts wander to my project and I ask myself if I'm taking the best approach. Notably, I had two epiphanies: 
<br>
-Instead of making the camera a child of the player, I will make the camera follow a child of the player, specifically the directional lighting since they seem to always be in the exact same spot. This has solved my camera control and smoothing problems. \*happy noises\* (It also seems my player scene restructuring was necessary, glad that hour and a half was worth it)
<br>
-I remembered reading in short about a property of transform called Basis which will return the normalized vector requested. I believe this can solve my orientation problem. Wish me luck.

## **Player Position Orientation and Map Gen Improvement**

Yay! After so many hours of research and dead ends I finally got the player orientation tracking to work. It turns out I just had to brush up on my vector math. This also allowed me to get the map generation fully operational. I still think I can tweak it a bunch, but it works for now.

If the rest of the project goes smoothly this will officially be the 1/3 completion point.
<br>
A little overview of what I intend to still add:
<br>
-Collectibles/ power-ups, enemies, obstacles
<br>
-Improved HUD
<br>
-Audio (movement-based sound effects and music)

## **Refactoring, Signals, Bumper Obstacle**

\*Personal Note\* Another hiatus (I'd be finished by now if I didn't keep doing this).

Joined the official Godot Discord server. Met some users who gave me a lot of sound advice (and also got some validation for this project - feels good). Using this newfound knowledge, I decided to refactor my code.

Took me the better part of 3 weeks, about 2-12 hours every day:
<br>
-Tossed out a lot of redundant code and moved some function calls around for efficiency.
<br>
-Removed a bunch of unnecessary/duplicate nodes.
<br>
-Set up global signals (learned how to better use signals)
<br>
-Improved a lot of object references in my scripts.
<br>
-Added object fade out distance to help with dizziness when moving

Foolish me, I tried to add a bumper obstacle while refactoring - this is probably why I took so long getting everything to work.
<br>
<br>
Eureka! Everything works as it should.

<img height=300 src="https://github.com/Nick-Marx/Godot/blob/main/Pivot/README/pivot_maj_milestone1_2.gif"/>  
</div>

All-in-all the game is running about 25% better with about 20% fewer lines of code.
<br>
I learned alot and am glad I did this.
<br>
Life is good!

## **Colors! and a Pause Menu**

Decided to add a splash of color by setting the background to randomize and lerp to another color at a steady interval. Need to pick better colors, but it works pretty well.
<br>
No help online for this one, but luckily I was able to stumble my way around it.

Changed player color; I really like this soft neon pink I found.

Made pause menu. This took me longer than I thought it would since there are tons of tutorials out there, but I have the bad habit of trying to change things to meet my needs at the same time I'm learning them so it all breaks and I have to fix it.
<br>
<br>
I know everything's still moving behind the menu so it doesn't really 'pause' anything right now except for the time, but I may eventually add a survival mode that includes an enemy that follows the player which would pause when the menu opens.
<br>
<br>
It's pretty minimalistic, but I like the style so far. I might change the buttons, text, and/or colors eventually.

## **Gameplay Mechanics, and Sound, and Bug Fixes, Oh My!**

Forgot to edit the devlog after my last update. I'll list the changes in order and I think I'll consider this my second major milestone. Not much longer and I feel Pivot might be ready to publish.
<br>
<br>
Made a map pivot timer set to 4 seconds for casual mode. This should prevent anyone from getting stuck. It's activated with the arrow keys, if I port this to mobile I'll probably set it to activate with swipes.
<br>
<br>
I decided on including a player trail and it does nothing. Now, hear me out... I think it looks neat.
<br>
<br>
Started messing with audio, and I'm straight up bad at it. It's fun and I have a good idea of what I want for the sound and feel of everything, but no matter what I try, nothing sounds good.
For any curious, I use the free opensource DAW LMMS. This being my first time using something like this, it took me forever just to get it setup and configured a little.
I took a break after many, many, MANY hours to add a few simple sound effects just to test things. It turned out ok, but needed quite a bit of tweaking before I was satisfied.
<br>
<br>
Another MANY hours later and I've come to the conclusion that I need a lot more practice before I can start creating my own tracks. So I selected some that I found online to use. Originally I only wanted these to be placeholders, but they sound better than enything I can make so I'll likely just keep them in.
All of this has made me realize that some of the features I want to add are currently beyond my ability and/or not supported fully in the current version of Godot.
<br>
<br>
Was able to get about halfway toward what I wanted for audio. During the main gameplay, there are two audio tracks that will alternate depending on if the player is on a fast streak or not.
<br>
<br>
Made a lot of little tweaks to things:
<br>
-Spinner enemy spawn rate will start low and increase as the player gets a higher score.
<br>
-Changed player starting and max speed to have a more noticeable difference.
<br>
-Added a fast streak score multiplier.
<br>
-Added a credits page in the menu.
<br>
-Fixed the newgame button to reset everything, not just the score.
<br>
-Modified dot collision areas to make it slightly easier to hit center and so a player can't just hold down the action key and keep their fast streak.
<br>
-Fixed bumper collision size too.
<br>
-Set the music to loop (this took me a while to find, it wasn't intuitive)
<br>
-Added play instructions to main menu.
<br>
<br>
I know this gif doesn't have sound, but if you take a moment to imagine the coolest songs you've ever heard overlayed on a slideshow of childrens drawings, then add some low quality special effects and you'll be in the ballpark of what this game sounds/feels like.

## **Better Menu and a New Mode, Finally Publishing**

It occured to me after the last edit that I haven't been posting the amounts of time it's taken for each task. I think somewhere along the line I developed a routine and now I don't even notice the time. But, for those keeping track, I've spent about 80 hours on research, 200 hours on writing/testing code, and 20 hours on outlining/conceptualizing total up till this point.
<br>
<br>
I added a new survival game mode with a chaser enemy that the player must avoid. I named the enemy TUV and it sparkles (this was to help players notice it easier when it creeps into their view).
<br>
<br>
I modified the main menu and added an options menu.
<br>
<br>
I don't plan on adding a gif with this edit since I've decided to publish the game. I feel that at this point it's complete enough to play, but for any more updates I will need a lot more practice making games and a lot more feedback. 
<br>
<br>

## **Final Thoughts**  

For anyone who's read this far, there's one thing I'd like you to take away from this: The entire experience, though challenging at times, was incredibly fun and rewarding.
<br>
<br>
Thank you so much for reading this devlog and I hope it can be at least a little help to you or anyone else looking to get into game development.
<br>
<br>
As I stated before, I compromised on a few features for this game. Here's a list of things I intend to update or add when I return to this project as a far more skilled developer:
<br>
-Expanded soundtrack
<br>
-Synchronized audio
<br>
-New game modes
<br>
-Improved graphics
<br>
-Better UI
<br>
-Collectables and powerups
<br>
-Online score keeping
<br>
<br>

## **Updates**  

v1.0.2:
* Fixed glow effect when played through browser.
* Adjusted audio volume to start at 25%.
<br>

v1.0.3:
* Added FSMs to handle pause state and menuing.
* Moved menu music control node.
<br>

## **v1.0.3 Thoughts**

I used this to practice FSMs. Conclusion: not very useful for the scope of this game, but I definitely see the usefullness in something larger in scale. Next I need to figure out Hierarchal FSMs; I will need to use them in my next game.

<br>

Note: \*I wanted to add this here in case anyone accuses me of retcon: All of my games are intended to build off each other and exist in the same 'universe'; Pivot is intended to be a meditative/mental practice tought to students in my 'Dream' settings\*

Note: GitHub MD sucks. It took me so many hours just to get this REAME formatted correctly and it still didn't turn out the way I wanted.
